# Keylogger

## 

# ‚ö†Ô∏èüößSTILL IN DEVELOPMENT ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß

As a placeholder I have added a really raw and unstable keylogger to suffice as I polish it up.


## Update 1 till full release, I havent managed to get the GUI down due to how FIGMA likes to export. 
Ill figure this one out...

Im planning to add a few hyperlinks to the left side of the scuffed UI or I might just knock it down.

## Update 2 till full release, I managed to fix the GUI (check commit notes)
Another issue to note that ive found is that if a user clicks on the output box their output will be doubled, this is due to the rectangle not being disabled for user input. 

Issue is... my solution of disabling the box just wont work so yeah. Fun.

## Upddate 3 Return

Going to rewrite this code with a sleek UI hopefully, but for now to fill up some sort of activity a requirements file will be added!
